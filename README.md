##  Objective
To identify phishing characteristics in suspicious email samples and document findings in a clear, structured format.


##  Files Included
- `emails/` – Contains screenshots of sample phishing emails.
- `analysis_reports/` – Contains detailed findings for each email.
- `summary.md` – A consolidated list of phishing indicators found across both samples.
- `email_authentication_basics.md`: Explains SPF and DKIM for email verification.


##  Sample Indicators Analyzed
